#Database Design

1. Users
Purpose: Represents guests and hosts. A user can be both.

Important fields:
id — unique identifier.
name — display name.
email — unique, used for login.
is_host — boolean flag to mark if user can list properties.
created_at — date the account was created.

Relationships:
One-to-Many with Properties (a host can have many properties, but each property belongs to one host).
One-to-Many with Bookings (a guest can have many bookings).
One-to-Many with Reviews (a user can write many reviews).
One-to-Many with Payments (a guest can make many payments).

2. Properties
Purpose: Represents a place to stay (house, apartment, etc.).

Important fields:
id — unique identifier.
host_id — foreign key to Users.
title — name of the property.
price_per_night — nightly rate.
location — city, state, country (or latitude/longitude).

Relationships:
Many-to-One with Users (host).
One-to-Many with Bookings (a property can have many bookings).
One-to-Many with Reviews (a property can have many reviews).

3. Bookings
Purpose: Represents a reservation for a property.

Important fields:
id — unique identifier.
property_id — foreign key to Properties.
guest_id — foreign key to Users (guest).
start_date — check-in date.
end_date — check-out date.

Relationships:
Many-to-One with Users (guest making the booking).
Many-to-One with Properties.
One-to-One or One-to-Many with Payments (one booking may have one payment, or partial/multiple payments).
One-to-One or One-to-Many with Reviews (typically one review per booking from each party).

4. Reviews
Purpose: Feedback and rating for a property or host.

Important fields:
id — unique identifier.
booking_id — foreign key to Bookings.
reviewer_id — foreign key to Users.
rating — numeric score (1–5).
comment — text feedback.

Relationships:
Many-to-One with Bookings (a booking can have multiple reviews — e.g., guest reviewing host, host reviewing guest).
Many-to-One with Users (reviewer).
Many-to-One with Properties (through booking).

5. Payments
Purpose: Tracks transactions for bookings.

Important fields:
id — unique identifier.
booking_id — foreign key to Bookings.
amount — payment amount.
status — e.g., pending, paid, refunded.
payment_method — e.g., card, PayPal, Stripe.

Relationships:
Many-to-One with Bookings.
Many-to-One with Users (payer — usually the guest).
Can be related to Properties indirectly via the booking.

# Features Overview

1. User Management
Handles guest and host registration, authentication, and profile management. This feature ensures secure login, allows users to update personal details, and controls roles (host vs. guest), enabling tailored access to property listing or booking capabilities.

2. Property Management
Allows hosts to create, update, and delete property listings with details such as location, price, amenities, and photos. This feature is essential for keeping the platform’s listings accurate and attractive, giving guests the information they need to make booking decisions.

3. Booking System
Enables guests to search for available properties, select dates, and make reservations. It ensures that availability is updated in real time, preventing double bookings and streamlining the reservation process for both guests and hosts.

4. Reviews & Ratings
Lets guests and hosts leave feedback about their stay or their experience with the other party. This feature builds trust in the platform by helping future users make informed decisions based on past experiences.

5. Payment Processing
Facilitates secure online payments for bookings, tracking amounts, statuses, and methods. It ensures a seamless transaction flow between guests and hosts, while providing a record of financial operations for both parties.

6. Search & Filtering (optional enhancement)
Allows users to filter properties by location, price range, amenities, and ratings. This feature improves the user experience by helping guests quickly find listings that match their preferences.

7. Database Optimizations
Focuses on structuring tables, indexing frequently queried fields, and using efficient query patterns to improve performance. This ensures that features like property search, booking lookups, and review retrieval remain fast even as the number of users and listings grows.

8. API Documentation
Provides a clear, interactive reference for all API endpoints, parameters, and expected responses. This helps frontend developers (or third-party integrators) understand how to connect to the backend, reducing integration errors and speeding up development.

#Key Security Measures

1. Authentication
What it is: Verifying the identity of users during login using secure methods such as JWT (JSON Web Tokens) or session-based authentication, with hashed and salted passwords.
Why it matters: Prevents unauthorized access to user accounts, protecting sensitive information such as personal details, booking history, and payment data.

2. Authorization
What it is: Controlling what authenticated users can do based on their role (guest, host, admin). For example, only hosts can edit their own property listings, and only the booking owner can cancel a reservation.
Why it matters: Stops users from performing actions they shouldn’t (e.g., editing another host’s listing), protecting both user content and system integrity.

3. Rate Limiting
What it is: Restricting the number of requests a user or IP address can make in a certain time frame.
Why it matters: Helps prevent brute-force attacks on login endpoints and reduces the risk of API abuse, which can degrade performance or cause downtime.

4. Data Encryption (in transit & at rest)
What it is: Using HTTPS (TLS/SSL) to encrypt data between client and server, and encrypting sensitive data (e.g., payment details) in the database.
Why it matters: Protects against eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks, ensuring user data and payment information can’t be intercepted.

5. Input Validation & Sanitization
What it is: Checking and cleaning all user inputs (search queries, forms, etc.) to prevent malicious code injections (SQL Injection, XSS).
Why it matters: Prevents attackers from manipulating queries or injecting harmful scripts, protecting the database and user sessions.

6. Secure Payment Processing
What it is: Using trusted third-party payment gateways (e.g., Stripe, PayPal) with PCI DSS compliance and tokenized transactions.
Why it matters: Keeps sensitive financial data out of your servers and ensures transactions are processed safely, maintaining user trust.

7. Logging & Monitoring
What it is: Keeping detailed logs of authentication attempts, admin actions, and suspicious activity, with alerts for anomalies.
Why it matters: Enables quick detection and response to security breaches, reducing potential damage.

#CI/CD Pipeline
CI/CD Pipelines (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment) are automated workflows that handle building, testing, and deploying your application whenever code changes are pushed.

Continuous Integration (CI): Ensures that new code is automatically tested and merged smoothly with the main codebase, catching bugs early.
Continuous Deployment (CD): Automates releasing tested code to staging or production environments, reducing manual deployment errors and speeding up feature delivery.

Why it’s important for the Airbnb clone:
It keeps the project stable by running tests automatically before deployment, ensures new features don’t break existing functionality, and allows quick, reliable releases of updates like new booking features or security fixes. This is critical for a platform handling real user data and payments.

Possible Tools:
GitHub Actions — integrates directly with your GitHub repository for automated workflows.
Docker — packages the app into containers for consistent environments across development and production.
Jenkins — highly customizable automation server for CI/CD.
GitLab CI/CD — integrated pipelines if you host your code on GitLab.
