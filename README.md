## 🗄 Database Design

### **1. Users**
**Purpose:** Represents guests and hosts. A user can be both.  
**Fields:**  
- `id` – Unique identifier  
- `name` – Display name  
- `email` – Unique, used for login  
- `is_host` – Boolean flag (can list properties)  
- `created_at` – Account creation date  

**Relationships:**  
- One-to-Many → Properties  
- One-to-Many → Bookings  
- One-to-Many → Reviews  
- One-to-Many → Payments  

---

### **2. Properties**
**Purpose:** Represents a place to stay (house, apartment, etc.).  
**Fields:**  
- `id` – Unique identifier  
- `host_id` – Foreign key to Users  
- `title` – Property name  
- `price_per_night` – Nightly rate  
- `location` – City/state/country or coordinates  

**Relationships:**  
- Many-to-One → Users (host)  
- One-to-Many → Bookings  
- One-to-Many → Reviews  

---

### **3. Bookings**
**Purpose:** Represents a reservation for a property.  
**Fields:**  
- `id` – Unique identifier  
- `property_id` – Foreign key to Properties  
- `guest_id` – Foreign key to Users (guest)  
- `start_date` – Check-in date  
- `end_date` – Check-out date  

**Relationships:**  
- Many-to-One → Users (guest)  
- Many-to-One → Properties  
- One-to-One / One-to-Many → Payments  
- One-to-One / One-to-Many → Reviews  

---

### **4. Reviews**
**Purpose:** Feedback and rating for a property or host.  
**Fields:**  
- `id` – Unique identifier  
- `booking_id` – Foreign key to Bookings  
- `reviewer_id` – Foreign key to Users  
- `rating` – Numeric score (1–5)  
- `comment` – Feedback text  

**Relationships:**  
- Many-to-One → Bookings  
- Many-to-One → Users (reviewer)  
- Many-to-One → Properties (via booking)  

---

### **5. Payments**
**Purpose:** Tracks transactions for bookings.  
**Fields:**  
- `id` – Unique identifier  
- `booking_id` – Foreign key to Bookings  
- `amount` – Payment amount  
- `status` – Payment status (pending, paid, refunded)  
- `payment_method` – Card, PayPal, Stripe  

**Relationships:**  
- Many-to-One → Bookings  
- Many-to-One → Users (payer)  
- Indirect relationship → Properties (via booking)

## 🚀 Feature Breakdown

1. **User Management** – Registration, authentication, and profile management for guests and hosts.  
2. **Property Management** – Create, update, and delete listings with details like price, amenities, and location.  
3. **Booking System** – Real-time reservation handling with availability updates.  
4. **Reviews & Ratings** – Feedback system to build trust between guests and hosts.  
5. **Payment Processing** – Secure transactions, tracking amounts, statuses, and methods.  
6. **Search & Filtering** *(optional)* – Find properties by location, price range, amenities, and ratings.  
7. **Database Optimizations** – Indexing and query improvements for performance.  
8. **API Documentation** – Interactive references for developers integrating with the backend.

## 🔒 API Security

1. **Authentication** – Secure login using JWT or sessions with hashed/salted passwords.  
2. **Authorization** – Role-based permissions to control actions for guests, hosts, and admins.  
3. **Rate Limiting** – Prevents brute-force attacks and API abuse.  
4. **Data Encryption** – HTTPS/TLS for data in transit, encryption for sensitive data at rest.  
5. **Input Validation** – Prevent SQL Injection and XSS attacks.  
6. **Secure Payment Processing** – Use PCI DSS-compliant third-party gateways (Stripe, PayPal).  
7. **Logging & Monitoring** – Detect and respond to suspicious activity quickly.

## ⚙️ CI/CD Pipeline

**CI/CD Pipelines** are automated workflows that build, test, and deploy the application whenever code changes are pushed.

- **Continuous Integration (CI):** Runs tests automatically before merging new code.  
- **Continuous Deployment (CD):** Pushes tested code to staging or production automatically.  

**Why it’s important:**  
Keeps the codebase stable, ensures quick releases, and reduces deployment errors — critical for platforms with real user data and payments.

**Tools:**  
- GitHub Actions  
- Docker  
- Jenkins  
- GitLab CI/CD  
- CircleCI
